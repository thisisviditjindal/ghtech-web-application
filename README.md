Q1.)Why did you decide on the framework choice you used as part of your solution?

A1.) I was less on time that is why I was not able to use Angular or react as part of the project as I was not able to learn it. So I used jquery beacuse of the animations and Document Object Model(DOM) for javascript. 

Q2.)Are there any improvements you could make to your submission?

A2.)Yes I could have made many improvments like layout in landing page, responsiveness(in Tablet), better configured chat room.

Q3.)What would you do differently if you were given more time?

A3.)I would have able to make data models and would be able to make this website using react framework. I would be able to make a backend for this project. 

Note:- I have made a react application too, but due to its bad rendering and glitches, I submitted the website made from HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
